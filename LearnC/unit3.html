<h2>Array</h2>
<p>An array is a type of data structure that stores a fixed-size of a homogeneous collection of data. In short,
     we can say that array is a collection of variables of the same type.

    For example, if we want to declare 'n' number of variables, n1, n2...n., if we create all these variables
     individually, then it becomes a very tedious task. In such a case, we create an array of variables having the
      same type. Each element of an array can be accessed using an index of the element.</p>
      <p>C array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. For example, if we want to store the marks of
         a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for the marks in the different subject.
          Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at the contiguous memory locations.</p>
        <h5>Properties of Array</h5>
        <ul><li>Each element of an array is of same data type and carries the same size, i.e., int = 4 bytes.
        </li>
        <li>Elements of the array are stored at contiguous memory locations where the first element is stored at the smallest memory location.
        </li>
        <li>Elements of the array can be randomly accessed since we can calculate the address of each element of the array with the given
             base address and the size of the data element.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Why do we need arrays? 
    </h5>
    <p>We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to store a large number of instances, it becomes 
        difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.</p>

<h5>Advantage of Array
</h5>  
<ul>
    <li><b>1) Code Optimization:</b> Less code to the access the data.</li>
 <li><b>2) Ease of traversing:</b> By using the for loop, we can retrieve the elements of an array easily.</li>
    <li><b>3) Ease of sorting:</b> To sort the elements of the array, we need a few lines of code only.</li>
    <li><b>4) Random Access:</b> We can access any element randomly using the array.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Disadvantage of Array</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>1) Fixed Size:</b> Whatever size, we define at the time of declaration of the array, we can't exceed the limit. So, it doesn't grow the size
         dynamically like LinkedList which we will learn later.

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to One Dimensional Array in C</h2>
<p>We can visualize a one-dimensional array in C as a single row to store the elements. All the elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.
     Now, we will see how to declare, initialize and access array elements:
</p>
<img style="height: 300px;width: 700px;" src="https://scaler.com/topics/images/1-%281%29.webp">
<h5>Rules for Declaring One Dimensional Array in C</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Before using and accessing, we must declare the array variable.
    </li>
    <li>In an array, indexing starts from 0 and ends at size-1. For example, if we have arr[10] of size 10, then the indexing of elements ranges from 0 to 9.
    </li>
    <li>We must include data type and variable name while declaring one-dimensional arrays in C.
    </li>
    <li>We can initialize them explicitly when the declaration specifies array size within square brackets is not necessary.
    </li>
    <li>Each element of the array is stored at a contiguous memory location with a unique index number for accessing.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>While declaring a one-dimensional array in C, the data type can be of any type, and also, we can give any name to the array, just like naming a random variable. <br>
    Syntax:

</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1" disabled>int arr[5]; //arr is the array name of type integer, and 5 is the size of the array  </textarea>
<h5>Initialization of One-Dimensional Array in C</h5>
<p>After declaration, we can initialize array elements or simply initialize them explicitly at the time of declaration. One-Dimensional arrays in C are initialized either at Compile Time or Run Time.</p>
<h6>Compile-Time Initialization
</h6>
<p>Compile-Time initialization is also known as static-initialization. In this, array elements are initialized when we declare the array implicitly. <br>Syntax:
</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2" disabled><data_type> <array_name> [array_size]={list of elements};
</textarea>
<p>C Program to illustrate Compile-Time Initialization:</p>
    
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="9" disabled>#include <stdio.h>
        int main(){
            int nums[3]={0,1,2};
            printf(" Compile-Time Initialization Example:\n");
            printf(" %d ",nums[0]);
            printf("%d ",nums[1]);
            printf("%d ",nums[2]);
        }
        </textarea>
        <b><p>Output:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 1 2</p></b>
        <p>In this C program code, we have initialized an array nums of size 3 and elements as 0,1 and 2 in the list. This is compile-time initialization, and then at the end, we have printed all its values by accessing index-wise.

        </p>
        <h6>Run-Time Initialization
        </h6>
        <p>Runtime initialization is also known as dynamic-initialization. Array elements are initialized at the runtime after successfully compiling the program.
<b><br>C Program to illustrate Run-Time Initialization:</b>
        </p>
        <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="21" disabled>#include < stdio.h >

            int main() {
              
                int nums[5];
                printf("\n Run-Time Initialization Example:\n");
                printf("\n Enter array elements: ");
            
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    scanf("%d", & nums[i]);
                }
            
                printf(" Accessing array elements after dynamic Initialization: ");
            
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    printf("%d ", nums[i]);
                }
            
                return 0;
            }
            </textarea>
        <p><b>Input</b></p>
            <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="4" disabled>Run-Time Initialisation Example:    

Enter array elements: 10 20 30 40 50
                </textarea>
                <p>
                <b>Output</b></p>
                <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2" disabled>Accessing array elements after dynamic Initialization: 10 20 30 40 50</textarea>
     
    <h5>Array Accessing</h5>
    <p>In one-dimensional arrays in C, elements are accessed by specifying the array name and the index value within the square brackets. Array indexing starts from 0
         and ends with size-1. If we try to access array elements out of the range, the compiler will not show any error message; rather, it will return some garbage value.
<br>Syntax:
    </p>
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1" disabled><arr_name>[index];</textarea>
<p>Example:</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="5" disabled>int nums[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    printf("%d", nums[0]); //Array element at index 0 is printed
    printf("%d", nums[-1]); //Garbage value will be printed
</textarea>    
<h5>C Program to illustrate declaration, initialization, and accessing of elements of a one-dimensional array in C:

</h5>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="16">#include < stdio.h >

    int main() {
       //declaring and initializing one-dimensional array in C
       int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30}; 
    
        // After declaration, we can also initialize the array as:
        // arr[0] = 10; arr[1] = 20; arr[2] = 30;
    
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            // accessing elements of array
            printf(" Value of arr[%d]: %d\n", i, arr[i]);
        }
    }
    </textarea>
    <h6 id="2d"></h6><br><br>
<h2>Two Dimensional Array in C</h2>
<p>The two-dimensional array can be defined as an array of arrays. The 2D array is organized as matrices which
     can be represented as the collection of rows and columns. However, 2D arrays are created to implement a 
     relational database lookalike data structure. It provides ease of holding the bulk of data at once which 
     can be passed to any number of functions wherever required.

</p>
<h5>Declaration of two dimensional Array in C</h5>
<p>Syntax:<br>
    <b>data_type array_name[rows][columns];</b> <br>Example:
</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1">int twodimen[4][3];  </textarea>
<p>Here, 4 is the number of rows, and 3 is the number of columns.
</p>
<h5>Initialization of 2D Array in C
</h5>
<p>In the 1D array, we don't need to specify the size of the array if the declaration and initialization are being 
    done simultaneously. However, this will not work with 2D arrays. We will have to define at least the second dimension
     of the array. The two-dimensional array can be declared and defined in the following way.
 </p>
 <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1">int arr[4][3]={{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{3,4,5},{4,5,6}};</textarea>
 <b><p>Two-dimensional array example in C</p></b>
 <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="13">#include<stdio.h>  
    int main(){      
    int i=0,j=0;    
    int arr[4][3]={{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{3,4,5},{4,5,6}};     
    //traversing 2D array    
    for(i=0;i<4;i++){    
     for(j=0;j<3;j++){    
       printf("arr[%d] [%d] = %d \n",i,j,arr[i][j]);    
     }//end of j    
    }//end of i    
    return 0;  
    }    
</textarea>
<p>Output:</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="12">
    arr[0][0] = 1
    arr[0][1] = 2

    <h6 id="pointer"></h6><br><br>
<h2>Pointers</h2>
<p>The pointer in C language is a variable which stores the address of another variable. This variable can be of type int, char, array,
   function, or any other pointer. The size of the pointer depends on the architecture. However, in 32-bit architecture the size of a pointer 
   is 2 byte.

</p>
<h5>Declaring a pointer
</h5>
<p>The pointer in c language can be declared using * (asterisk symbol). It is also known as indirection pointer used to dereference a pointer.

</p>

<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2">int *a;//pointer to int  
    char *c;//pointer to char</textarea>
    <h5>Pointer Example</h5>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/pointer.png">
    <p>As you can see in the above figure, pointer variable stores the address of number variable, i.e., fff4. The value of number variable is
       50. But the address of pointer variable p is aaa3.

        By the help of * (indirection operator), we can print the value of pointer variable p.
        
        Let's see the pointer example as explained for the above figure.</p>
        <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="13">#include<stdio.h>  
            int main(){  
            int number=50;    
            int *p;      
            p=&number;//stores the address of number variable    
            printf("Address of p variable is %x \n",p); // p contains the address of the number therefore printing p gives the address of number.     
            printf("Value of p variable is %d \n",*p); // As we know that * is used to dereference a pointer therefore if we print *p, we will
             get the value stored at the address contained by p.    
            return 0;  
            }    </textarea>
            <p>Output:</p>
            <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="3">
Address of number variable is fff4
Address of p variable is fff4
Value of p variable is 50</textarea>

<h6 id="pointera"></h6><br><br>
<h2>Pointer Arithmetic in C</h2>
<p>We can perform arithmetic operations on the pointers like addition, subtraction, etc. However, as we know that pointer contains
   the address, the result of an arithmetic operation performed on the pointer will also be a pointer if the other operand is of type 
   integer. In pointer-from-pointer subtraction, the result will be an integer value. Following arithmetic operations are possible on the
    pointer in C language:</p>
    <h5>Incrementing Pointer in C
</h5>
<p>If we increment a pointer by 1, the pointer will start pointing to the immediate next location. This is somewhat different from the general 
  arithmetic since the value of the pointer will get increased by the size of the data type to which the pointer is pointing.

</p>
<p>We can traverse an array by using the increment operation on a pointer which will keep pointing to every element of the array, perform some
   operation on that, and update itself in a loop.
</p>
<b><p>Let's see the example of incrementing pointer variable on 64-bit architecture.</p></b>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="12">#include<stdio.h>  
int main(){  
int number=50;        
int *p;//pointer to int      
p=&number;//stores the address of number variable        
printf("Address of p variable is %u \n",p);        
p=p+1;        
printf("After increment: Address of p variable is %u \n",p); // in our case, p will get incremented by 4 bytes.      
return 0;  
}    </textarea>
<b><p>Output:</p></b>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2">Address of p variable is 3214864300 
After increment: Address of p variable is 3214864304 </textarea>
<h5>Decrementing Pointer in C</h5>
<p>Like increment, we can decrement a pointer variable. If we decrement a pointer, it will start pointing to the previous location. The formula of decrementing the pointer is given below:
</p>
<p>Let's see the example of decrementing pointer variable on 64-bit OS</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="10">#include <stdio.h>            
void main(){            
int number=50;        
int *p;//pointer to int      
p=&number;//stores the address of number variable        
printf("Address of p variable is %u \n",p);        
p=p-1;       
printf("After decrement: Address of p variable is %u \n",p); // P will now point to the immidiate previous location.         
}      </textarea>
<b><p>Output:</p></b>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2">Address of p variable is 3214864300 
After decrement: Address of p variable is 3214864296 </textarea>

<h6 id="pointerf"></h6> <br><br>
<h4>Pointer to function</h4>
<p>Like the pointer to normal variables, we can also use pointers to point the functions. <br>Like every
   variables function also has unique memory address.</p>
   <strong>Function pointer syntax: <br></strong>
   <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1"> void (*fptr)(); </textarea><br><p>We must enclose the function pointer variable with (). like (*fptr).

    Where *fptr is a function pointer, capable of referring a function whose return type is void and also it will not take any argument (). </p>
   <b>Example:</b> <br>
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="18">
      /*Program  : Function Pointer with argument*/    
     #include<stdio.h>
     int sum(int x, int y)
     {
         return x+y;
     }
     
     int main()
     {
         int ans;

<h4>How to declare a function which accepts a pointer as an argument?</h4>
<p>If a function wants to accept an address of an integer variable then the function declaration will be,</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1">return_type function_name(int*);</textarea>
<p>Here, we are passing the address of a variable.

  So, if we change the argument value in the function, it will modify the actual value of a variable. <br><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  
  <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="15">#include<stdio.h>
    void setToZero(int *a)
    {
      *a = 0;
    }
    int main()
    {
      int a = 10;
      printf("Before calling the function a = %d\n",a);
    
      setToZero(&a);
      printf("After calling the function a = %d\n",a);
    
      return 0;
    }</textarea>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2">Before calling the function a =10
After calling the function a = 0</textarea>
<b><p>Visual Representation:</p></b>
<img src="https://www.log2base2.com/images/c/pass-pointer-argument-to-function.png">
<br> <br>
<ol>
  <li>Address of a variable a 1024 is passed to function setToZero().</li>
  <li>*a = 0 will modify the original value of a. So, a value in main function will be 0 after the function execution.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pointer to Pointer</h4>
<p>Pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection or a chain of pointers.
  Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a
  pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second
  pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value as shown
  below.</p>
  <img style="width: 60%;" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190710183146/Pointer-To-Pointer.jpg">
  <br> <br>
  <p>A variable that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared as such. This is done
    by placing an additional asterisk in front of its name. For example, following
    is the declaration to declare a pointer to a pointer of type int − <br>
    <b>int **var;</b></p>
<p>When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer,
  accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice, as
  is shown below in the example −
  </p>
  <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="17">#include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main () {
     int var;
     int *ptr;
     int **pptr;
     var = 3000;
     // take the address of var
     ptr = &var;
     // take the address of ptr using address of operator &
     pptr = &ptr;
     // take the value using pptr
 cout << "Value of var :" << var << endl;
 cout << "Value available at *ptr :" << *ptr << endl;
 cout << "Value available at **pptr :" << **pptr << endl;
 return 0;
}</textarea>
<p><b>Output:</b></p>

<h2>Array of pointers:</h2>
<p>
  When we require multiple pointers in a C program, we create an array of
   multiple pointers and use it in the program. We do the same for all the
    other data types in the C program.</p>
    <p>When we want to point at multiple variables or memories of the
       same data type in a C program, we use an array of pointers.

      Let us assume that a total of five employees are working at a cheesecake factory. We can 
      store the employees’ names in the form of an array. Along with this,
       we also store the names of employees working at the office, the library, and the shoe store.
      
      Now, let us assume that once we read all the names of the employees randomly, 
      we want to sort all of the employees’ names working in the cheesecake factory.
       Sorting all the employee names requires reading, swapping, and copying a lot of data. But
        since we have stored all the employee names in groups/ arrays, we can directly
         refer to the array of names of employees working at the cheesecake factory.</p>
<h5>Declaration of array of pointer</h5>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="1">int *ary[55]</textarea>
<p>This one is an array of a total of 55 pointers. In simple words, this array is capable 
  of holding the addresses a total of 55 integer variables. Think of it like this- the ary[0]
   will hold the address of one integer variable, then the ary[1] will hold the address of the 
   other integer variable, and so on.
<br><b>Example:</b></p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="15">#include<stdio.h>
  #define SIZE 10
  int main()
  {
  int *arr[3];
  int p = 40, q = 60, r = 90, i;
  arr[0] = &p;
  arr[1] = &q;
  arr[2] = &r;
  for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  printf(“For the Address = %d\t the Value would be = %d\n”, arr[i], *arr[i]);
  }
  return 0;
  }</textarea>
  <p>The output generated out of the program mentioned above would be like this:</p>
  <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="4">For the Address = 387130656 the Value would be = 40
For the Address = 387130660 the Value would be = 60
For the Address = 387130664 the Value would be = 90</textarea>

<h2>C Strings</h2>
<p>The string can be defined as the one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null ('\0').
   The character array or the string is used to manipulate text such as word or sentences. 
  Each character in the array occupies one byte of memory, and the last character must always be 0
  . The termination character ('\0') is important in a string since it is the only way to identify
   where the string ends. When we define a string as char s[10], the character s[10] is implicitly
    initialized with the null in the memory.
  <h4>Declaration of Strings</h4>
<br>Let's see the example of declaring string by char array in C language.
</p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="2">char str_name[size];
  <b>Example: </b>char ch[10]={'j', 'a', 'v', 'a', 't', 'p', 'o', 'i', 'n', 't', '\0'};</textarea>
   <p>In the above syntax str_name is any name given to the string variable and size is used to define the length of the string, i.e the number of characters strings will store. 
    Note: There is an extra terminating character which is the Null character (‘\0’) used to indicate the termination of a string that differs strings from normal character arrays.
     When a Sequence of characters enclosed in the double quotation marks is encountered by the compiler, a null character ‘\0’ is appended at the end of the string by default.</p>
     <p>A string can be initialized in different ways. We will explain this with the help of an example. Below are the examples to declare a string with the name str and initialize it with “GeeksforGeeks”.</p>
     <br><br><h6 id="access"></h6>
     <h3><strong>4 Ways to Initialize a String in C</strong></h3>
     <p><strong>1. Assigning a string literal without size: </strong>String literals can be assigned without size. Here, the name of the string str acts as a pointer because it is an array.</p>
     <pre>char str[] = "LearnC"; </pre>
     <p><strong>2. Assigning a string literal with a predefined size: </strong>String literals can be assigned with a predefined size. But we should always account for one extra space which will be assigned to the null character. If we want to store a string of size n then we should always declare a string with a size equal to or greater than n+1.</p>
     <pre>char str[50] = "LearnC";</pre>
     <p><strong>3. Assigning character by character with size:</strong> We can also assign a string character by character. But we should remember to set the end character as ‘\0’ which is a null character.</p>
     <pre>char str[14] = { 'G','e','e','k','s','f','o','r','G','e','e','k','s','\0'};</pre>
     <p><strong>4. Assigning character by character without size:</strong> We can assign character by character without size with the NULL character at the end. The size of the string is determined by the compiler automatically.</p>
     <pre>char str[] = { 'G','e','e','k','s','f','o','r','G','e','e','k','s','\0'};</pre>

     <br><br><p>Let us now look at a sample program to get a clear understanding of declaring, initializing a string in C, and also how to print a string with its size.</p>
     <textarea name="" id="" cols="90" rows="17">// C program to illustrate strings

      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <string.h>
      int main()
      {
        // declare and initialize string
        char str[] = "LearnC";
        // print string
        printf("%s\n", str);
        int length = 0;
        length = strlen(str);
        // displaying the length of string
        printf("Length of string str is %d", length);      
        return 0;
      }
      </textarea>
<p><b>Output:</b></p>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="2">LearnC
Length of string str is 6</textarea>
